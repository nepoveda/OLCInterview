 # OLC interview tasks
 For python tasks I used python 3.12.
 So add project to your `PYTHONPATH`

```bash
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/olc-interview-tasks
```
 
## Snakes and Ladders
This is a simple implementation of the game Snakes and Ladders. For interview purposes, I have implemented the game in Python. The game is played by two players. The players take turns to roll a dice and move their respective pieces on the board. The first player to reach the end of the board wins the game.

### Running the game

```bash
  python snakes_and_ladders/main.py
```

### Running the tests

```bash
  python -m unittest -b
```
